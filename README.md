DashMat
=======

This is a dashboard framework written in Python.

More documentation and tests are coming. First we convert it to react.

To deploy, I suggest looking at http://github.com/realestate-com-au/dashmat-deploy

```
pip install -e .
npm install
npm run build
dashmat --config example.yml.example
